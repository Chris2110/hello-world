# hello-world
familiarise with new tools
I want to learn how to use the new tools
Later going for some Satay
After that going home
And after that shower n sleep
I live in an exciting world
But before sleeping I will do some surfing and watch some 'look mum no compiter on youtube'
I spelt computer wrongly in the last line
